Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, in which the next state of each cell in the automaton is decided based on only 
four simple rules. Starting from an initial pattern or state, application of these rules to each cell leads to surprising 
patterns as generations pass.
In this Javascript implementation of it, a simple toroidal 2d array has been used to generate the grid, and a dynamically sized stack has been used to implement a feature to trace a pattern all the way back to its initial condition.
